    Override/substitute existing events. For example, if the current on-call is unexpectedly busy from 3-4, another
    user can override that event for that time period and take over the shift. Override may delete or edit
    existing events, and may create new events. The API's response contains the information for all undeleted
    events that were passed in the event_ids param, along with the events created by the override.

    Params:
        - **start**: Start time for the event substitution
        - **end**: End time for event substitution
        - **event_ids**: List of event ids to override
        - **user**: User who will be taking over
